Template: quenb-client/control-server-url
Type: string
Default: "http://quenb.agnomen.org/webclient"
_Description: QuenB control server URL:
 Please provide the full HTTP URL of the QuenB control server
 that this client should contact. The string __MAC__ will
 be replaced with the MAC address of the client. It will usually
 look like:
 .
 http://hostname.domain.name/webclient?mac=__MAC__
 .
 You can change this later by editing the config file, or by running:
 .
 sudo quenb-client --write-config --control-url=<URL>


Template: quenb-client/install-on-boot
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install QuenB client to run on boot?
 QuenB can install itself to start on boot - i.e. the Raspberry Pi boots up,
 starts LXDE, and runs a fullscreen web browser pointing at the QuenB server.
 This will work on non-Raspberry Pi clients, but you will need to manually
 ensure that LXDE is the default desktop environment. Your existing LXDE
 configuration will be preserved. You can do this yourself later by running:
 .
 sudo quenb-client --install-on-boot
