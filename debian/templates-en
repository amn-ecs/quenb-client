_description: Install QuenB client to run on boot?
 QuenB can install itself to start on boot - i.e. the Raspberry Pi boots
 up, starts LXDE, and runs a fullscreen web browser pointing at the QuenB
 server. This will work on non-Raspberry Pi clients, but you will need to
 manually ensure that LXDE is the default desktop environment. Your
 existing LXDE configuration will be preserved. You can do this yourself
 later by running:
 .
 sudo quenb-client --install-on-boot
Default: false
